# Jim's Exercism.io Solutions!

Call me crazy, but my relentless curiosity has made me want to experiment with ***EVERY*** programming language there is!

Luckily, I have stumbled upon (actually, a colleague told me about it) Exercism.io which is a excellent website for learning any programming language AND learning how to write unit tests for it!

Without getting too into why Exercism is fantstic, it has a little companion cli tool that makes you work from your own command line and local computer. Each problem sets you up with a complete project, and when you are in your own IDE, using the common cli tools for each language, and running the tests it really makes you like you are a developer of that language- you're really doing it! You work through each problem by making each unit test pass, one by one. I find this to be an excellent form of "TDD with training wheels" in that you don't have to write any unit tests yourself, but you get to experience the usefullness of leveraging them to build correctly working software quickly!

As if all this wasn't enough, there are _mentors_ who will comment on your solutions, offer a more efficient or more cleanly written solution, and answer any questions you may have. This can make you aware of things you didn't even know you didn't even know, and just really helps shorten the feedback loop for learning how to recognize great code.

And so, this repo contains my (Jim's) solutions to the problems I have finished... and not yet finished. üòÅ
