# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

```text
One for S, one for me.
```

Where S is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name    | String to return 
|:------:|:-----------------: 
|Sarah   | One for Sarah, one for me.
|Alice   | One for Alice, one for me. 
|Eric    | One for Eric, one for me.
|        | One for you, one for me.
